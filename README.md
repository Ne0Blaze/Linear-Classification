# Thought Process
The project started out as a Monkeypox indentifies model as its a hot topic in medical sector right now and on th verge of an outbreak  
but there was no public dataset available with poper data to train a model, so we choose "Heart stroke" data that we well formated and  
available on Kaggle..... The same model architecture can be used to train over a Monkeypox dataset
